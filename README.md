# OpenGL Ray-Tracer with Portals
The Ray Tracer is written in C and OpenGL. It is non-functioning as of now as it depends on libraries which I cannot upload to GitHub.
The ray-tracer runs in real-time on GPU, and has functioning spherical portals. Due to the spherical nature of the portals, objects seem to jump when going through them when looking from certain angles. The camera transitions seemlessly however.
